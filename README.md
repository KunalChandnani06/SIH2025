üáÆüá≥ SAI Talent Assessment Platform (STAP)
Democratizing sports talent identification in India using AI-driven, low-cost mobile assessment.

üéØ The Challenge: Bridging the Talent Gap
India's vast and diverse geography presents a significant hurdle for standardized sports talent scouting. Aspiring athletes, particularly those in rural and remote areas, frequently lack access to formal assessment facilities.
The traditional model suffers from:
Infrastructure Constraints: Difficulty setting up standardized test environments nationwide.
Lack of Scalability: Manual, centralized assessment cannot handle mass participation.
Inefficiency & Inauthenticity Risk: Subjectivity in manual evaluation and high potential for manipulated or inconsistent data.
This absence of a reliable, scalable assessment model prevents the Sports Authority of India (SAI) from efficiently discovering and supporting the country's most promising athletes.

üí° Our Solution: Mobile-First, AI-Powered Assessment
The SAI Talent Assessment Platform (STAP) is a lightweight, mobile-based solution designed to put a standardized sports assessment facility directly into the hands of every aspiring athlete.
It leverages the ubiquity of smartphones to turn common athletic tasks (vertical jump, shuttle run, sit-ups, etc.) into verifiable data points, making talent identification accessible, objective, and scalable.
Core Platform Objectives
Accessibility: Low-cost and optimized for entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks.
Standardization: Provides a scientific, uniform method for measuring the prescribed fitness test battery (Annexure A).
Security: Securely transmits verified performance data to SAI servers for centralized evaluation and athlete profiling.

‚ú® Core Features & Innovation
STAP‚Äôs innovative edge lies in its use of AI/ML for on-device analysis and verification, transforming raw video into trusted, actionable data.

1. AI & Verification Modules (The Brains)
Feature
Functionality
Technology Focus

üß† AI-based Cheat Detection
Identifies anomalies, tampering, or incorrect form/movements (e.g., incomplete sit-ups, early start in runs) to ensure the integrity of the assessment.
Object Recognition, Motion Tracking

‚è±Ô∏è Offline Video Analysis
Performs preliminary performance analysis (counting reps, detecting peak height, measuring time) directly on the device, minimizing data usage and reliance on continuous internet connection.
Edge AI, On-Device ML Model Optimization (TensorFlow Lite)

üìà Performance Benchmarking
Provides immediate, objective feedback by comparing the athlete's results against pre-defined, age/gender-based benchmarks.
Local Database, Statistical Modeling

üéûÔ∏è Auto-Test Segmentation
Automatically detects the start and end of a specific test segment within a longer recording (e.g., isolating the precise moment of a jump or a turn in a shuttle run).
Time-Series Analysis, Keypoint Detection

2. User Experience & Scalability (The Interface)
Gamified User Interface (GUI): Engages athletes through interactive visuals, progress badges, and public/private leaderboards to encourage consistent participation and practice.
Intuitive Video Recording: Simplifies the process of recording, guiding the athlete (or a coach/parent) through the correct setup and capture procedure for each test.

Secure Submission Pipeline: Only securely verified, AI-stamped data is prepared for submission, ensuring the backend receives clean, reliable information.
Official Dashboard: A separate web dashboard for SAI officials to view, sort, and evaluate verified performance data across regions and age groups.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack (Inferred)
Component
Technology
Rationale
Mobile Application
React Native / Flutter
Cross-platform compatibility (Android/iOS) and single codebase for low-cost development and maintenance.
On-Device AI/ML
TensorFlow Lite / ML Kit
Enables high-performance, low-latency machine learning models that run efficiently on resource-constrained, entry-level smartphones.
Backend / Data Storage
Firebase / AWS Amplify
Scalable, secure cloud infrastructure for handling large volumes of athlete data, authentication, and secure data transfer.
Test Verification Logic
Node.js / Python (Microservices)
For processing and final validation of submitted data before it enters the official SAI profile database.

üöÄ Expected Impact
The SAI Talent Assessment Platform is set to revolutionize sports scouting in India by delivering:
Democratization: Reaches millions of potential athletes in remote and underserved regions who were previously excluded from the talent pipeline.
Scalability & Cost-Efficiency: Enables mass participation in talent identification drives at a significantly lower cost compared to traditional physical camps.
Transparency & Objectivity: Provides scientific, unbiased evaluation, improving efficiency and public trust in the selection process.
